      Hi — I’m Jun. I’m a data scientist and developer based in Southern
      California, with a background in applied data science, analytics, and
      systems thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy building things that sit at the intersection of data, code, and
      real-world impact — from predictive models and data tools to personal
      projects and experiments.
    </p>

    <p>This site is a living space for my work, ideas, and ongoing projects.</p>
